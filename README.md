# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This is my first project working with the Bootstrap CDN. It is a recreation of my first portfolio website "Basic-Portfolio." It is not my current and updated portfolio.

This portfolio website is separated into 3 HTML pages for an about page, portfolio page, and a contact page. I take advantage of the use of columns and rows from Bootstrap. It is not fully responsive, since I haven't learned about what responsiveness was at this point in time. The "Connect With Me" side module has links to my current GitHub, LinkedIn, and Stakoverflow profiles.
